	    Glass Mall is a complex of online shops - a modern, virtual version of the traditional shopping mall. Customers can shop from any merchandiser anywhere in the world regardless of their physical location. The experience is made immersive by leveraging augmented reality (AR) and wearable computing devices such as Google Glass. They can get to any store they want with a simple verbal command, and have their purchases delivered to their doorstep without the hassle of lugging them around. Shop owners can customize their storefronts just as they would a physical store. They can also hire virtual salespeople to help customers with any questions or requests. Fast food vendors can set up menus and deliver food items directly to the customer's house.

	    The interface that is presented to the customer is that of a real physical storefront, with items neatly laid out on counters and shelves. Each item is tagged with product details including price and options. Customers can pick up an item by getting near and pointing at it, which will generate a full-scale model of the product that the user can zoom, pan, rotate, buy, or share with their friends and social networks.

		  With eCommerce sites, you get added convenience at the expense of the retail experience. While many eCommerce sites have vastly improved their user experience and user interfaces, and some have even ventured into other channels such as mobile, none have made any attempts to break through the impersonal barrier of the screen to deliver a much more immersive, fun, and recreational experience leveraging emerging technologies that can bridge the gap between the physical & virtual worlds. Glass Mall will offer all the convenience of an eCommerce site while simultaneously innovating on the online retail & shopping experience. This also provides shop owners the opportunity to be very creative with their digital retail presence in order to fully communicate their brand's message & personality to the customer. We are betting on wearable computing devices such as Google Glass to become pervasive in the coming years, and this is an effort to stay one step ahead and deliver a service that will be useful and relevant in the new world. While the risk always exists that the big eCommerce players could create their own virtual AR shopping malls, we believe that in this new, emerging channel, there is no clear winner yet.

		  Our initial goal is just $100,000, which allows us to purchase the necessary equipment and staff this project with a dedicated team of designers & engineers. The bulk of this will be spent on:
		  <br>
		  <b>Google Glass</b> - Glass Mall is meant to be accessed using wearable computing devices to maximize the realism of the customer/shopper experience. To develop on Google Glass, we need Google Glass. We will consider other wearable computing devices as well, but we will focus on Glass for the moment. For those of you who are not fans of Google Glass and would rather see this implemented on another wearable computing device, drop us a note and we will consider it for the future roadmap. We will also provide a mobile version of the shopping mall to keep the market size viable at the beginning as Google Glass gains traction. You'll always have the option to shop from the mobile interface if you wish, but the power of Glass Mall lies in the realistic experience that wearable computing devices coupled with augmented reality delivers.
		  <br>
		  <b>UI/UX Designers</b> - Augmented reality is not yet a pervasive technology, and we will require the best UI/UX designers to create an interface that is functional and pleasing to use. This is one area that we don't want to skimp on, because we believe that this will only succeed if the user experience is top-notch. This is not something that exists today, which makes this more difficult but also more exciting. If we reach our goal, you will be part of the team that pioneered virtual reality commerce.
		  <br>
		  <b>Software Engineers</b> - Hand-in-hand with the UI/UX designers, we will staff a dedicated team of software engineers who will make this platform come to life. The software will have two groups of users - customers and shop owners. Both will be developed as part of this initial round of funding. Sure, we expect that we will make radical changes to the platform over the course of its life, but we hope to have something fully functional by the end of the first round. Just as a real physical shopping mall takes time to architect & build, we expect this platform to take six months to a year to come to life, but by the end of it, you would have access to a virtual reality shopping mall that is the first of its kind.
